  12. HEX CHEATS(APPLE)

On AppleWin you can use save states, which captures a snapshot of your 
players in the game's memory. This is handy because you can edit on the fly--
maybe even restore charges to an item, or change its alignment, or just give 
yourself a ton of experience and gold. I used them a lot to get around 
certain issues. Each character's data is 128 bytes. So:

char 1 0x470 char 2 0x4f0
char 3 0x570 char 4 0x5f0
char 5 0x670 char 6 0x6f0
char 7 0x770 char 8 0x7f0

I assume you have a working knowledge of hex for this, but still, back up 
your work once you start. Multibyte values are littleendian(least significant 
first.) Here's the structure. You add the following below to edit the various 
hex bytes:

0x00 slot # on disk(00-17 for A-X)
0x01 town you started in
0x02-0x0b your character's name, ORed with 0x80.
0x0c gender, 0=m 1=f 2=n(??)
0x0d actual alignment, 0-1-2=good-neutral-evil
0x0e race, 0-1-2-3-4 human-elf-dwarf-gnome-halforc
0x0f class, 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 kni-pal-arc-cle-sor-rob-nin-bar
0x10 might(actual)
0x11 intelligence(actual)
0x12 personality(actual)
0x13 speed(actual)
0x14 accuracy(actual)
0x15 luck(actual)
Next are the resistance percentages. These aren't defaults.
0x16 magic
0x17 fire
0x18 electricity
0x19 cold
0x1a energy
0x1b sleep
0x1c fear
0x1d acid
0x1e thieving %
0x1f Armor Class - speed
0x20-0x21 MaxHP
0x22 temporary might
0x23 temporary speed
0x24 temporary accuracy
0x25 temporary alignment
0x26 temporary level
0x27 temporary spell level
0x28-0x29 CurSP
0x2a temporary endurance
0x2b temporary intelligence
0x2c temporary personality
0x2d temporary luck
0x2e level (actual)
0x2f age
0x30 days old
0x31-0x34 experience
0x35-0x36 MaxSP
0x37 spell level(actual)
0x38-0x39 Gems
0x3a-0x3b CurHP
0x3c-0x3d MaxHP
0x3e-0x40 Gold
0x41 armor class
0x42 food
0x43 condition
FYI:
0=OK 1=cursed 2=silent 4=diseased 8=poisoned 10=asleep 20=paralyzed 
40=unconscious
All of these can be ORed up to 7f. But 81=dead, 82=stone and all other values 
are eradicated.
0x44 endurance(actual)
0x45-0x4a index # of item equipped in slot 1-6
0x4b-0x50 index # of backpack item in slot 1-6
0x51-0x56 # of charges of item equipped in slot 1-6
0x57-0x5c # of charges of backpack item in slot 1-6
0x5d-0x62 magic index (+x) of item equipped in slot 1-6
0x63-0x68 magic index (+x) of backpack item in slot 1-6
0x69-0x6c ???? these bytes rely on you having various items. I don't know the 
specifics but they don't seem important. Perhaps it is about random luck 
functions during combat?
0x6d high/low bytes = skills. Skills are 0(clear) through f, in alphabetical 
order.
[none] / Arms Master / Athlete / Cartographer /
Crusader / Diplomat / Gambler / Gladiator /
Hero-heroine / Linguist / Merchant / Moutaineer(sic) /
/ Navigator / Pathfinder / Pickpocket / Soldier /
0x6e-0x73 spell flags. Low byte of 6e = 1-1, and you move up from there.
0x74-0x7f Quest specific flags, I think. Maybe I'll figure them all out one 
day.

Byte 0xa0 in the save state file determines your location. The high nibble(4 
bits) is the y-location, the low is the x-location. That's how I got through 
Woodhaven 2 without too much torture.
